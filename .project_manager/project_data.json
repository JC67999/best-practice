Self-learning AI assistant with memory persistence across sessions that makes granular, small changes (\u226430 lines) to maintain development standards while supporting 24/7 autonomous coding capability The absolute minimum includes: CLAUDE.md file with project standards, quality gate script that blocks bad commits, and project objective clarification at project start. Features NOT in v1: fully autonomous 24hr coding (that's v2), automatic code refactoring, AI-generated tests",
