    "problem": "Claude Code projects often lack consistent quality standards, project structure, and delivery practices, leading to code that may have bugs, poor documentation, unclear objectives, and inconsistent organization across different projects.",
    "target_user": "Myself (JC) working on Claude Code projects across multiple repositories, and potentially other developers who want to maintain consistent quality standards in their AI-assisted development workflows.",
    "solution": "A toolkit consisting of three MCP servers (Memory, Quality, Project), a CLAUDE.md standards file, quality gate scripts, and retrofit tools that can be copied into any Claude Code project to enforce objective clarification, quality standards, minimal root structure, and proper documentation practices. Self-learning AI assistant with memory persistence across sessions that makes granular, small changes (\u226430 lines) to maintain development standards while supporting 24/7 autonomous coding capability The absolute minimum includes: CLAUDE.md file with project standards, quality gate script that blocks bad commits, and project objective clarification at project start. Features NOT in v1: fully autonomous 24hr coding (that's v2), automatic code refactoring, AI-generated tests",
    "success_metrics": "Successfully retrofit at least 3 existing Claude Code projects with the toolkit, all projects pass quality gates consistently, project objectives are clearly defined with clarity scores >80, minimal root structure is maintained (\u22645 folders), and the toolkit can be installed and used in a new project in under 10 minutes. For production/live projects, the toolkit has a light touch without affecting existing functionality, whereas non-live projects can have full implementation of best practices including structural changes.",
