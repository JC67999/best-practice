 I built a tool that codes while I sleep – new update makes it even smarter 💤⚡
Built with Claude

Hey everyone,

A couple of months ago I shared my project Claude Nights Watch here. Since then, I’ve been refining it based on my own use and some feedback. I wanted to share a small but really helpful update.

The core idea is still the same: it picks up tasks from a markdown file and executes them automatically, usually while I’m away or asleep. But now I’ve added a simple way to preserve context between sessions.

Now for the update: I realized the missing piece was context. If I stopped the daemon and restarted it, I woudd sometimes lose track of what had already been done. To fix that, I started keeping a tasks.md file as the single source of truth.

    After finishing something, I log it in tasks.md (done ✅, pending ⏳, or notes 📝).

    When the daemon starts again, it picks up exactly from that file instead of guessing.

    This makes the whole workflow feel more natural — like leaving a sticky note for myself that gets read and acted on while I’m asleep.

What I like most is that my mornings now start with reviewing pull requests instead of trying to remember what I was doing last night. It’s a small change, but it ties the whole system together.

Why this matters:

    No more losing context after stopping/starting.

    Easy to pick up exactly where you left off.

    Serves as a lightweight log + to-do list in one place.

Repo link (still MIT licensed, open to all):

If you decide to try it, my only advice is the same as before: start small, keep your rules strict, and use branches for safety.

Hope this helps anyone else looking to squeeze a bit more productivity out of Claude without burning themselves out.

We’ve all been there. You’re deep in the zone, vibe dev mode engaged, hammering Enter on every suggestion until the code either miraculously ships or spectacularly explodes, dropping a one-line “fix it” that earns the classic “You’re absolutely right!”, and then bam: your 5-hour Claude Code window taps out. You’ve already done the 100 push-ups, the vision board, the cold plunge, the gratitude journal; even your notes are color coded. Depending on your plan, that cap can hit sooner than you’d like. Nothing kills momentum like a multi-hour cooldown mid-session.

Meet ccblocks. This lightweight helper schedules Claude Code CLI triggers throughout the day to start new 5-hour windows before you need them. Kick one off at 06:00 while you’re asleep; sit down at 09:00 and you’re already three hours into a fresh window for those hardcore Opus planning tasks, with a usage reset coming much sooner than usual.

Is this a workaround? Not quite; Claude’s limits still apply. ccblocks just optimises when sessions begin so you get maximum coverage during actual working hours.

Sleepless Agent — Turn Your Unused Claude Credits into an Autonomous AgentOS
Built with Claude

Ever looked at your Claude u and thought… “man, I’m not even using half of these”?

What if you could turn that unused compute into something that works while you sleep?

That’s what Sleepless Agent is about —

an AgentOS built on Claude Code, designed to capture your random thoughts, half-baked project ideas, or TODOs — and then let your AI finish them overnight.
How It Works

You just drop an idea like:

    “make me a pitch deck for my new open-source project”

and go to sleep.

By morning, your agent has:

    brainstormed the concept

    written the README

    drafted the slides

    maybe even pushed an initial repo update

All powered by Claude Agent SDK, so it inherits every dev feature:

file access, function tools, structured agents, interactive execution — but now fully automated through an AgentOS daemon that runs your tasks.
Example Use Cases

    💬 Capture your stray ideas anytime — your agent will pick them up later.

    📊 Want a PPT from your notes? Just drop a one-line prompt.

    🔎 Want to crawl Xiaohongshu for specific posts (like all “相亲” threads)? Add the Xiaohongshu MCP — your agent will find them while you sleep.

    ⚙️ Plug in any Claude Code-compatible toolchain. It just works.

Why “Sleepless”

Because your agent never sleeps — it turns late-night creativity into next-morning results.

It’s like having a background AI cofounder who actually works on your ideas while you rest.

 A tool that codes while I am sleeping! : Claude Nights Watch
Productivity

Hey everyone,

So I built this thing called Claude Nights Watch about 2 months ago and it's been working pretty well for me, thought let me share my experience and maybe help some of you automate your workflows too.

What it does: Instead of just keeping Claude sessions alive, it actually executes tasks from a markdown file when your usage window is about to expire. So like, I can write "refactor this function" or "add tests for X module" and it'll do it automatically while I am sleeping or in meetings.

Repository: https://github.com/aniketkarne/ClaudeNightsWatch

I have added example rules which I personally use into repo, so modify or change, use it wisely.

The good stuff:

    Been using it for ~2 months with zero issues

    No bans or problems with Claude (I think timing matters - it executes right before the 5-hour window expires, not spamming) i usually do it at 3.30hour window.

    Actually gets useful work done while I am not around, or went out to get some grocery!

    All conversations are logged so I can see exactly what happened

    Saves me hours of repetitive coding tasks

Well, I really like the Scheduled Start and Smart Timing, This helps me to mostly code at night and by morning my bugs are fixed, a features is done, a workflow is completed.

Really a good night sleep!

just a bit of showoff so this features are really worth it, i think it took me more time to prepare this read me than actually buiding one :D

    Autonomous Execution: Runs tasks without manual intervention

    Task-Based Workflow: Define tasks in a simple markdown file

    Safety Rules: Configure safety constraints in rules.md

    Smart Timing: Uses ccusage for accurate timing or falls back to time-based checking

    Scheduled Start: Can be configured to start at a specific time

    Comprehensive Logging: Track all activities and executions

    Based on Proven Code: Built on the reliable claude-auto-renew daemon

The reality check:

    I DON'T give it massive tasks like "build me a full app" - that's asking for trouble

    I stick to small, focused features. Like "add error handling to this function" or "write unit tests for this module" or "here is the info.md fix this error"

    The rules.md file is CRITICAL. Like, stupidly important. I spent time making mine really restrictive

    I always commit my work before running it and create a feature branch

    Keep backups of everything important

    Not everything works perfectly - maybe 80% success rate for me

My typical workflow:

    Commit current work to git

    Create feature branch (git checkout -b feature/auto-task)

    Write specific task in task.md

    Write/update safety rules in rules.md

    Let it run (./claude-nights-watch-manager.sh start)

    Review the changes and logs when I'm back

    Merge if good, rollback if not

Safety stuff (this is important):

    It uses --dangerously-skip-permissions so it can run without prompts

        My rules.md has like 50 lines of "don't do this" and "never do that"

        I test tasks manually first before automating them

        Never let it touch production code directly

        Always work in feature branches

        The logging shows you EXACTLY what prompt was sent and Claude's full response

Setup is pretty easy:

git clone https://github.com/aniketkarne/ClaudeNightsWatch.git
cd ClaudeNightsWatch
chmod +x *.sh
./setup-nights-watch.sh

The interactive setup walks you through creating your first task and rules files.

What doesn't work well:

    Complex tasks that need back-and-forth - mostly user intervention (obviously)

    Tasks requiring external API keys or credentials

    Anything that needs user input during execution

    Tasks that depend on real-time data

The logging is actually really nice - you can see the exact prompt it sent and Claude's full response. Helped me debug when things went wrong and understand what Claude was thinking.

Well, this is not magic and you need to be careful. But if you're doing repetitive coding tasks and want to automate some of them, it might be worth checking out.

Pro tips from 2 months of usage:

    Start with SUPER simple tasks

    Be paranoid about your rules file

    Always use git branches

    Check the logs after each run

    Don't let it run unsupervised until you trust it

Code is on GitHub, MIT license so do whatever you want with it. There's a test suite and examples to get you started.

Update: Question: Why the hell are we buying max plans? To use it at maximum right? For our use?
