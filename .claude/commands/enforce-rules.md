# Enforce Rules: Critical Constraints Checklist

> **Purpose**: Prevent scope creep and wandering by validating all 5 Critical Constraints are defined BEFORE coding starts.

## Why This Matters

The #2 Failure Mode is **Scope Too Big (Claude Wanders)**:
- Tasks >30 lines → Claude invents features
- No file boundaries → touches unnecessary files
- No constraints → adds dependencies freely
- "While we're here..." → scope creep

**This command prevents that by forcing explicit boundaries.**

## Constraint Validation

Before starting ANY implementation, define these 5 Critical Constraints:
